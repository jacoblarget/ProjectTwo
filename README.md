### Title

Pokemon: Red & Black Pokedex

### Description

This project will store a group of Pokemon and sort them based on three different criteria: name, combat power, generation, and type.
Users will be able to filter based on these criteria and then list the Pokemon.
This application will be beneficial for users who wish to recreate the joy of filling up their pokedex like back in the old days.
